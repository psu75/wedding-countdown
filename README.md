=================

Pebble Watchface with real-time countdown to wedding date and time.

Inception and designed by Kyle Barry Burnett. 

This watchface shows real-time interval of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Shows the time in a bottom banner

In order to use for your own countdown, you'll need to change the following and re-compile: 

- Modify the "name" variable up to 16 characters
- Modify the "wedding_date" 
- Modify the "wedding_time"

You could use this to countdown for any event; just change the verbiage accordingly.

With version 1.0, the event time must be at the top of the hour. I'll eventually address up to the excat hour and minute.
